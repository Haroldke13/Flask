    <h1>Latest developments in climate change</h1>
    <p>Carbon Footprint Calculator is <b>an application that helps individuals calculate their carbon footprint and find offset projects</b>. As of 2023, the global carbon emissions have increased by 1.5% compared to 2022. The world is facing a climate crisis, and it is crucial that we take action to reduce our carbon footprint. Here are some recent updates in the climate change battle:</p>
    
    <h2>COP26</h2>
    <p>The Conference of the Parties (COP26) took place in Glasgow, UK, from 26 September to 10 October 2022. It was a crucial meeting where countries came together to discuss the Paris Agreement and the roadmap for achieving net-zero emissions. The talks focused on the need for urgent action to address climate change and the importance of reducing carbon emissions. The COP26 resulted in the signing of the Glasgow Common Statement, which outlines a series of actions countries must take to strengthen their climate commitments.</p>
    
    <h2>COP27</h2>
    <p>The second Conference of the Parties (COP27) was held in Marrakech, Morocco, from 7 November to 12 December 2018. This meeting built on the success of COP21 and further emphasized the need for countries to take bold action to address climate change. The Marrakech Accord adopted by the Conference represents a significant step forward in the fight against climate change. It sets out a roadmap for countries to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>
    
    <h2>The Paris Agreement</h2>
    <p>The Paris Agreement is an international treaty aimed at <b>reducing greenhouse gas emissions</b> and addressing climate change. It was signed in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015 by 196 countries. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting global warming to well below 2째C (3.6째F) above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5째C (2.7째F). The agreement also aims to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy and promote sustainable development. The Paris Agreement has been a cornerstone of international climate action and has paved the way for further efforts to address climate change.</p>
    
    <p>As we move towards a low-carbon economy, it is crucial that we take action now. By reducing our carbon footprint and finding offset projects, we can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. So, join the battle against climate change and start calculating your carbon footprint today.</p>
    
    <p>By calculating your carbon footprint, you can gain a better understanding of the impact of your daily activities on the environment. This knowledge can help you make informed decisions about reducing your carbon emissions. You can calculate your carbon footprint by considering factors such as transportation, electricity usage, food consumption, and waste generation. Once you have calculated your carbon footprint, you can start looking for offset projects to reduce your emissions. Offset projects involve investing in initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as reforestation, renewable energy projects, or carbon capture technologies. By offsetting your emissions, you can help mitigate the impact of climate change.</p>
